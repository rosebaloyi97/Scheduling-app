Large colleges, universities, and educational institutes offering a wide variety of courses and
a vast student intake cannot afford to let such inconsistencies hamper their day-to-day
operation.
Moreover, it becomes increasingly difficult to effectively schedule lectures and maintain
attendance records by merely relying on manual methods of data logging.
This system assists with automating the process of scheduling lectures and tracking students’
attendance. Besides assisting with scheduling, this system classifies staff and students’
records according to their respective subjects, thereby making data retrieval easy.
